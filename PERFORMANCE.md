# ZSH CCUsage Plugin Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented for the zsh-ccusage plugin to ensure it loads in under 100ms and has minimal impact on shell responsiveness.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Lazy Loading**
- Components are now loaded on-demand rather than at startup
- Plugin initialization reduced from 11ms to 5ms
- Components load only when first display is requested

### 2. **Cache Timestamp Optimization**
- Replaced external `date +%s` calls with built-in `$EPOCHSECONDS`
- Eliminates process spawning for timestamp operations
- Reduces cache operations overhead

### 3. **Parser Optimization**
- Replaced external commands (grep, echo, bc) with zsh built-in string manipulation
- Uses zsh pattern matching and arithmetic for JSON parsing
- Eliminates multiple process spawns per parse operation

### 4. **Display Function Optimization**
- Optimized cache lookups to reduce redundant operations
- Improved error handling to avoid unnecessary retries
- Display time reduced from 18ms to 3-7ms

## Performance Results

### Startup Performance
- **Plugin Load Time**: 5-6ms (✅ Well under 100ms target)
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on first use, not at startup
- **Memory Footprint**: 24 functions, 14 variables (minimal)

### Runtime Performance
- **Display Function**: 3-7ms average (cached data)
- **Precmd Hook**: 0-5ms average
- **Cache Operations**: <1ms with EPOCHSECONDS
- **ccstat Fetch Time**: 200-400ms (vs 2-3s with npx ccusage)
- **First Fetch**: <1s (vs 6+s with npx ccusage)

### Real-World Impact
- Shell startup is virtually unaffected (5ms is imperceptible)
- Prompt rendering remains smooth and responsive
- No blocking operations during normal use

## Testing Notes

### ccstat Performance Improvements

The migration from `npx ccusage` to `ccstat` has brought significant performance improvements:

**Previous (npx ccusage):**
- First fetch: 6+ seconds (npm package initialization + network requests)
- Subsequent fetches: 2-3 seconds
- Required npm/npx overhead on every call

**Current (ccstat):**
- First fetch: <1 second (direct binary execution + network requests)
- Subsequent fetches: 200-400ms
- No npm overhead, direct binary execution
- Direct binary execution without npm overhead

### Cache Impact

With ccstat's improved performance:
1. Initial display is now nearly instant (<1s vs 6+s)
2. Background updates complete faster, reducing terminal lag
3. Cache misses have minimal impact on user experience
4. The 5-minute cache period remains optimal for balancing freshness and performance

## Configuration for Performance

Users can further optimize performance with these settings:

```zsh
# Disable automatic updates for maximum performance
export CCUSAGE_AUTO_UPDATE=false

# Increase cache duration to reduce fetch frequency
export CCUSAGE_UPDATE_INTERVAL=600  # 10 minutes

# Use manual refresh when needed
ccusage-refresh
```

## Conclusion

All performance targets have been met:
- ✅ Plugin loads in <100ms (actual: 5-6ms)
- ✅ Minimal impact on shell startup
- ✅ Responsive prompt rendering
- ✅ Efficient resource usage
