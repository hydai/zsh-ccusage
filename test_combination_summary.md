## Test Results

### Normal Terminal Width (≥80 characters)

| Cost Mode | Percentage Mode | Expected Display | Actual Display | Status |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| active | daily_avg | `[$45.23A \| 85%D]` | `[$45.23A \| 85%D]` | ✓ |
| active | daily_plan | `[$45.23A \| 85%P]` | `[$45.23A \| 85%P]` | ✓ |
| active | monthly | `[$45.23A \| 85%M]` | `[$45.23A \| 85%M]` | ✓ |
| daily | daily_avg | `[$20.45D \| 310%D]` | `[$20.45D \| 310%D]` | ✓ |
| daily | daily_plan | `[$20.45D \| 50%P]` | `[$20.45D \| 50%P]` | ✓ |
| daily | monthly | `[$20.45D \| 900%M]` | `[$20.45D \| 900%M]` | ✓ |

| monthly | daily_plan | `[$1800.00M \| 50%P]` | `[$1800.00M \| 50%P]` | ✓ |
| monthly | monthly | `[$1800.00M \| 900%M]` | `[$1800.00M \| 900%M]` | ✓ |

### Compact Mode (Terminal width < 80 characters)

All combinations display in compact format: `$XX.XXC|XX%P` where C is the cost suffix and P is the percentage suffix.

## Key Findings

1. **Independent Modes**: Cost and percentage modes work independently as designed
2. **Suffix Display**: Each mode correctly displays its suffix:
   - Cost modes: A (active), D (daily), M (monthly)
   - Percentage modes: D (daily_avg), P (daily_plan), M (monthly)
3. **Format Consistency**: Display format is consistent across all combinations
4. **Color Coding**: Percentage values are color-coded based on thresholds (green <80%, yellow 80-99%, red ≥100%)

## Example Combinations from Requirements

The following examples from the requirements document have been verified:

- **Daily cost + monthly percentage**: `[$20.45D | 900%M]` ✓
- **Monthly cost + daily average percentage**: `[$1800.00M | 310%D]` ✓

## Test Scripts Created

1. `test_cost_percentage_combinations.zsh` - Full integration test (requires ccusage)
2. `test_format_combinations.zsh` - Format function test
3. `test_final_combinations.zsh` - Simplified combination test

All formatting logic has been verified to work correctly for the 9 possible combinations.
